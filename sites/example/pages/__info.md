## Header

This is a content inside your root `__info.md` file (which is located inside `sites/example/pages/__info.md`). It is your main page!
This file also contains all configuration for your website (default meta info, title on top of the page, GA key, etc), and this meta info is merged with post's meta later.

All folders should contain this `__info.md` file, which will provide meta information and basic info.
Each folder means different section (in the top menu).
